- A general purpose Discord bot (or at least what I'm aiming for)

- Moderation system
    -> Kick
    -> Ban
    -> Warn
    -> Mute
    -> Clean chat

- Fun
    - NHentai
        -> Look through nhentai via an API, but since there's no oficial API, It'll
           be a webscrapping module 

    - search (look up something in google)
    - yt (search videos in youtube)
    - meme (get a random meme from x source, probably my personal folder)
    - Music bot:
        - no fucking idea
    

- Miscellaneous
    - Cooldown
    - Spam filter
    - ... (this means that I also have no idea)

- CLI
    - Instead of running the bot as it is, provide a Command Line Interface in which the admin will be able
    to execute commands through

    - A very primite example: select a guild, perform an action in such guild


- Multi-guild support: I don't know a thing of how I'm supposed to do this, I've already seen some bots which do the same thing
                       that I'm talking about such as RoboDanny. The only thing I see out of this is a rewrite of the whole code


- OS-Agnostic: I expect this to work for both Windows & Linux at least for a long time, so no worries

- Frontend: Some examples are dyno.gg, MEE6, etc. I don't know how to do this tbh, have to learn some webdev in first place so
            this will be the last thing I'll code. Expect it to come in late 2090 probably

PD: I don't know a thing about discord.py, not even in the slightest
